Feedback:
1. The live sessions are going at correct pace and we would like to continue with the same pace because it is difficult to grasp if too many topics are covered in a single lecture.
2. We require more time to complete the self learning sections. Some of the self learning videos don't provide a good understanding on the concepts so we need to depend on the trainer to teach them.
3. Because of some misunderstadings in the last feedback the live lectures pace has increased which is making it difficult to understand the topics.
4. As the upcoming topics which will be covered are important so we require more time to complete the self learning sections.
